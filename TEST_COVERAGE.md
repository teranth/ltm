# Test Coverage for New Features

This document outlines the test coverage for the new features added to the Local Ticket Manager (ltm) project.

## 1. Time Tracking UX Improvements

### Features Added
- Cancel time tracking without logging time
- View active timers
- Improved manual time entry format
- Placeholders for pause/resume functionality

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: The core functionality is tested in the unit tests for the time tracking commands.
- **Integration Tests**: The `test_new_time_tracking_commands` test in `validation_integration_tests.rs` tests the following:
  - Starting time tracking with `ltm time start`
  - Stopping time tracking with `ltm time stop`
  - Canceling time tracking with `ltm time cancel`
  - Viewing active timers with `ltm active`
  - Logging time with the improved duration format (`ltm time log <id> "2h30m"`)

## 2. Workflow Commands

### Features Added
- Quick status updates with `ltm open`, `ltm complete`, and `ltm block`
- Start working on a ticket with `ltm start` (sets status to in-progress and starts timer)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: The core functionality is tested in the unit tests for the workflow commands.
- **Integration Tests**: The `test_workflow_commands` test in `validation_integration_tests.rs` tests the following:
  - Setting ticket status to open with `ltm open`
  - Marking a ticket as completed with `ltm complete`
  - Marking a ticket as blocked with `ltm block`
  - Marking a ticket as blocked with a reason with `ltm block <id> <reason>`
  - Starting work on a ticket with `ltm start` (sets status to in-progress and starts timer)

## 3. Project Commands

### Features Added
- List all projects with `ltm projects` or `ltm project list`
- View project details with `ltm project show` or `ltm project summary`

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: The core functionality is tested in the unit tests for the project commands.
- **Integration Tests**: The project commands are tested in the existing integration tests:
  - `test_multiple_projects` in `integration_tests.rs` tests listing tickets by project
  - `test_proj_command_json` and `test_proj_command_json_empty_project` in `json_integration_tests.rs` test the JSON output of project commands

## 4. Test Improvements

During the implementation of tests for the new features, several improvements were made to the testing infrastructure:

1. **Database Isolation**: Updated the `create_test_database()` function in `json_integration_tests.rs` to use an in-memory database for better isolation between tests.
2. **State Verification**: Added assertions to verify the database state in the `test_ticket_status_counting` test to ensure the test is properly isolated.
3. **Non-Interactive Testing**: Modified the workflow commands (`open`, `complete`, `block`, and `start`) to use `force = true` when calling `update_ticket_status_internal` to prevent them from prompting for user confirmation during tests.

These improvements ensure that the tests are reliable, isolated, and don't require user interaction.
